## Goal  
Enhance system monitoring by adding custom metrics for transaction processing.  

## Technical approach  
Implement custom metrics using a monitoring library such as Prometheus or StatsD. Update the logging and metrics modules to track key performance indicators (KPIs) for transaction processing.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Custom metrics for transaction processing are defined and recorded  
- [ ] Metrics are accessible via the monitoring dashboard  
- [ ] Unit tests cover metric recording and retrieval  
- [ ] pytest passes
