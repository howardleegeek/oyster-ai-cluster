## Goal  
Implement a robust transaction retry mechanism for failed transactions.  

## Technical approach  
Modify the existing transaction handler to include a retry logic with exponential backoff. Update the corresponding unit tests to cover retry scenarios.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Transaction retries occur with exponential backoff when a failure is detected  
- [ ] Unit tests cover successful retries and maximum retry attempts  
- [ ] pytest passes
