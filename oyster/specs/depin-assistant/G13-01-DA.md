## Goal  
Implement a robust transaction handler for processing Ethereum transactions securely and efficiently.

## Technical approach  
Utilize Ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transactions are signed and broadcasted correctly. Implement error handling for common transaction issues such as nonce errors and gas estimation failures. Update the existing transaction processing module to incorporate these changes.

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for transaction signing and broadcasting  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Transaction signing and broadcasting functions are implemented  
- [ ] Error handling for nonce errors and gas estimation failures is in place  
- [ ] Basic tests for transaction processing pass  
- [ ] pytest passes
