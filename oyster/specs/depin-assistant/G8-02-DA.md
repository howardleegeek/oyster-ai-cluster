## Goal  
Automate transaction processing based on AI-driven categorization.  

## Technical approach  
Enhance the transaction processor to utilize AI-categorized data for automated decision-making. Implement logic to handle different transaction categories according to predefined rules.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Transaction processor uses AI-categorized data  
- [ ] Automated actions are triggered based on transaction categories  
- [ ] pytest passes for transaction processor module
