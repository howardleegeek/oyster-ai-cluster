## Goal  
Integrate trained AI model into the AI handler for real-time processing.  

## Technical approach  
Modify the AI handler to load the trained model and process incoming transaction data in real-time. Ensure that the model inference is efficient and does not introduce latency.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI handler loads the trained model  
- [ ] Real-time transaction data is processed without significant latency  
- [ ] pytest passes for AI handler module
