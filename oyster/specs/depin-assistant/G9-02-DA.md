## Goal  
Implement basic monitoring for API response times and error rates.  

## Technical approach  
Use the Prometheus client library to collect and expose metrics. Integrate middleware to track API response times and error rates. Write tests to ensure metrics are correctly collected and exposed.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] API response times are tracked and exposed as Prometheus metrics  
- [ ] Error rates are tracked and exposed as Prometheus metrics  
- [ ] pytest passes
