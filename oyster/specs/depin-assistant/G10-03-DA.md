## Goal
Integrate AI-driven analytics to predict transaction behavior.

## Technical approach
Use Python's machine learning libraries to analyze historical transaction data and predict future behavior. Integrate the AI model with the existing Node.js backend using a REST API to provide real-time predictions.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] AI model provides predictions with at least 80% accuracy  
- [ ] Predictions are available via the REST API  
- [ ] pytest passes for AI integration tests
