## Goal  
Automate routine tasks using a rule-based workflow system.  

## Technical approach  
Design and implement a rule-based system to handle automated tasks. Develop triggers and actions in Python and integrate them with the existing JavaScript-based workflow engine. Update tests to cover automated task execution.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Rule-based workflows are defined and can be triggered by events  
- [ ] Automated tasks execute correctly based on defined rules  
- [ ] Unit tests cover workflow execution and task triggering  
- [ ] pytest passes
