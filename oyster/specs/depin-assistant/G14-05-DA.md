## Goal  
Develop an automated workflow management system to streamline repetitive tasks and improve efficiency.  

## Technical approach  
Use Node.js to create a workflow manager that orchestrates automated tasks based on predefined configurations. Use Ethers.js to interact with blockchain transactions as part of the workflows. Write unit tests to ensure workflows are executed correctly and handle edge cases gracefully.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Workflows are executed based on configuration  
- [ ] Ethers.js interactions with blockchain are seamless  
- [ ] Edge cases are handled gracefully  
- [ ] pytest passes
