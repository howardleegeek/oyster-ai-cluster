## Goal  
Strengthen the security framework by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and enhancing authentication mechanisms.  

## Technical approach  
Use Node.js to implement RBAC, defining roles and permissions within the system. Integrate OAuth 2.0 for authentication, ensuring secure access to system resources. Write unit tests to verify that access controls are enforced and authentication flows work as expected.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] RBAC is correctly implemented and enforced  
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 integration is secure and functional  
- [ ] Access to system resources is controlled based on roles  
- [ ] pytest passes
