## Goal  
Implement load testing for critical API endpoints to ensure performance under high traffic.  

## Technical approach  
Use a load testing tool like k6 to simulate high traffic on critical API endpoints. Analyze the results and adjust server configurations or code as necessary to improve performance. Write tests to validate the load testing setup and results.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Critical API endpoints handle high traffic without significant performance degradation  
- [ ] Load testing results are collected and analyzed  
- [ ] pytest passes
