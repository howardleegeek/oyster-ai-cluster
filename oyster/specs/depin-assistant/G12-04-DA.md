## Goal  
Strengthen authentication and authorization mechanisms.  

## Technical approach  
Implement JWT-based authentication and enhance the token validation process. Update security modules to enforce stricter access controls and write tests to ensure secure handling of authentication tokens.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated and validated correctly  
- [ ] Access controls are enforced based on token claims  
- [ ] Unit tests cover token generation, validation, and access control  
- [ ] pytest passes
