## Goal  
Integrate a new AI model for predictive analytics in transaction patterns.  

## Technical approach  
Update the AI integration module to include a new predictive analytics model using Python. Ensure the model is loaded and utilized correctly within the existing workflow. Add tests to verify the model's predictions.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 1 new file  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for the AI integration  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] New AI model is integrated and loaded correctly  
- [ ] Predictive analytics functionality is operational  
- [ ] Tests for AI predictions are in place  
- [ ] pytest passes
