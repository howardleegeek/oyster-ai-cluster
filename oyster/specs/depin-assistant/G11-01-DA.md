## Goal  
Enhance the transaction processing efficiency by optimizing the existing handler functions.  

## Technical approach  
Refactor the `transactionHandler.js` to use asynchronous processing with Ethers.js for non-blocking operations. Implement error handling for failed transactions and add corresponding unit tests.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 1 new file  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for the refactored functions  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Asynchronous processing is implemented for transaction handling  
- [ ] Error handling for failed transactions is in place  
- [ ] Existing unit tests are updated to reflect changes  
- [ ] pytest passes
