## Goal
Implement advanced logging mechanisms to enhance monitoring capabilities.

## Technical approach
Integrate a centralized logging library like Winston with Ethers.js to capture blockchain interactions and errors. Configure log levels and ensure logs are stored in a structured format for easier analysis.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Logs are captured for all blockchain interactions and errors  
- [ ] Log levels can be configured via environment variables  
- [ ] pytest passes for logger-related tests
