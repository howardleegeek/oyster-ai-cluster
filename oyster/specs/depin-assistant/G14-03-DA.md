## Goal  
Enhance the monitoring service to track system performance metrics and alert on anomalies.  

## Technical approach  
Use Node.js to collect system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and network latency. Configure alerts using a configuration file to notify administrators of anomalies. Write unit tests to ensure metrics are collected accurately and alerts are triggered appropriately.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] CPU, memory, and network metrics are collected accurately  
- [ ] Alerts are triggered for predefined anomalies  
- [ ] Configuration file correctly sets alert thresholds  
- [ ] pytest passes
