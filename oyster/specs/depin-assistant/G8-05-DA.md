## Goal  
Implement AI-driven automation management for depin-assistant.  

## Technical approach  
Develop an automation manager that orchestrates AI-driven actions based on transaction processing outcomes. Ensure that the manager can handle multiple automation tasks concurrently and is resilient to failures.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Automation manager orchestrates AI-driven actions  
- [ ] Multiple automation tasks are handled concurrently  
- [ ] pytest passes for automation manager module
