## Goal  
Implement AI model training and evaluation pipeline.  

## Technical approach  
Develop a Python module to train the AI model using historical transaction data. Include evaluation metrics to assess model performance and update the model periodically.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI model is trained using historical transaction data  
- [ ] Evaluation metrics are calculated and logged  
- [ ] pytest passes for model trainer module
