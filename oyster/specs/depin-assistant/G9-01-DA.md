## Goal  
Implement secure encryption for sensitive user data using AES-256.  

## Technical approach  
Integrate the CryptoJS library into the existing codebase to handle AES-256 encryption and decryption. Update utility functions to use the new encryption methods and write corresponding unit tests.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Sensitive user data is encrypted using AES-256 before storage  
- [ ] Encrypted data can be decrypted successfully using the correct key  
- [ ] pytest passes
