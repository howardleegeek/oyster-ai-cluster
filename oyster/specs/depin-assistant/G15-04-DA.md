## Goal  
Automate routine tasks using AI-driven workflows.  

## Technical approach  
Develop Python scripts that utilize AI to identify and automate repetitive tasks. Integrate these scripts with the existing Node.js backend to execute workflows based on AI analysis. Ensure that the automation process is reliable and can be easily managed.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI-driven automation workflows are implemented  
- [ ] Backend integration allows for execution of automated tasks  
- [ ] Unit tests cover workflow execution and error handling  
- [ ] pytest passes
