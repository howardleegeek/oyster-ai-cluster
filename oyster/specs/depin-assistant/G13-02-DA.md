## Goal  
Integrate AI-driven analytics to predict transaction success rates and suggest optimal gas prices.

## Technical approach  
Leverage a Python-based AI model to analyze historical transaction data and predict success rates. Use Ethers.js to fetch current gas prices and integrate the AI suggestions into the transaction handling workflow. Ensure the AI model is called asynchronously to avoid blocking transaction processing.

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for AI integration and gas price suggestions  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI model is integrated and provides success rate predictions  
- [ ] Gas price suggestions are generated based on AI analysis  
- [ ] Asynchronous calls to the AI model are implemented  
- [ ] Basic tests for AI integration pass  
- [ ] pytest passes
