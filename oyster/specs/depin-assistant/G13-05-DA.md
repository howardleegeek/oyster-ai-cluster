## Goal  
Create an automation engine that orchestrates AI-driven processes and security responses.

## Technical approach  
Develop an automation engine using Node.js that coordinates AI-driven analytics and security responses. The engine will prioritize and execute actions based on the severity of detected issues and the predicted impact on transaction success. Use Ethers.js to interact with the blockchain for executing corrective actions.

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for the automation engine's decision-making and execution  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Automation engine coordinates AI-driven analytics and security responses  
- [ ] Actions are prioritized based on severity and predicted impact  
- [ ] Ethers.js is used to execute corrective actions on the blockchain  
- [ ] Basic tests for the automation engine pass  
- [ ] pytest passes
