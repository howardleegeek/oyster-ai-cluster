## Goal  
Enhance the security of the depin-assistant system by implementing a security module that detects and mitigates threats.

## Technical approach  
Develop a security module that monitors for suspicious activities such as unusual transaction patterns and potential smart contract vulnerabilities. Utilize Ethers.js to analyze transaction data and integrate with external threat intelligence feeds. Implement automated responses to detected threats, such as rate limiting and transaction blocking.

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for threat detection and response mechanisms  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Security module monitors for suspicious transaction patterns  
- [ ] Integration with external threat intelligence feeds is in place  
- [ ] Automated responses to detected threats are implemented  
- [ ] Basic tests for security module pass  
- [ ] pytest passes
