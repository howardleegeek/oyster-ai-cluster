## Goal  
Integrate a pre-trained AI model for predictive transaction analysis.  

## Technical approach  
Load a pre-trained model using a Python library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Implement inference logic to analyze transaction data and update the AI module to handle model inputs and outputs.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI model successfully loaded and inference can be performed on transaction data  
- [ ] Inference results are stored in the appropriate data structures  
- [ ] pytest passes
