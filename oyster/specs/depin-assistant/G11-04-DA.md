## Goal  
Strengthen the authentication mechanism with multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

## Technical approach  
Implement MFA using Ethers.js for generating and verifying tokens. Update the authentication module to support MFA and ensure it integrates seamlessly with the existing login flow. Add unit tests to verify MFA functionality.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 1 new file  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for MFA  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] MFA is implemented and integrated with the authentication flow  
- [ ] Tokens are generated and verified correctly  
- [ ] Tests for MFA are in place  
- [ ] pytest passes
