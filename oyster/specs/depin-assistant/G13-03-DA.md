## Goal  
Develop a monitoring service to track the health and performance of the depin-assistant system.

## Technical approach  
Implement a monitoring service using Node.js that tracks key metrics such as transaction throughput, latency, and error rates. Use Ethers.js to gather blockchain-specific metrics. Store the collected data in a lightweight database and provide basic visualization through a dashboard.

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for monitoring metrics collection and dashboard functionality  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Monitoring service collects transaction throughput, latency, and error rates  
- [ ] Blockchain-specific metrics are gathered using Ethers.js  
- [ ] Collected data is stored in a lightweight database  
- [ ] Basic dashboard for visualizing metrics is implemented  
- [ ] Basic tests for monitoring service pass  
- [ ] pytest passes
