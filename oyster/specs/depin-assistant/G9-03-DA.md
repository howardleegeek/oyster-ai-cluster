## Goal  
Enhance JWT token security by implementing token expiration and revocation.  

## Technical approach  
Modify the JWT token generation and validation logic to include expiration and revocation checks. Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens, such as maintaining a blacklist of revoked tokens. Write unit tests to verify token expiration and revocation functionality.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] JWT tokens expire after the specified time  
- [ ] Revoked tokens are rejected by the validation logic  
- [ ] pytest passes
