## Goal  
Develop a monitoring dashboard and alert system for tracking system performance and security.  

## Technical approach  
Leverage Node.js and Ethers.js to collect blockchain data and system metrics. Use a frontend library like React to create a dashboard that displays real-time data. Implement an alert system that triggers notifications based on predefined thresholds.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard is implemented  
- [ ] Alert system triggers notifications for critical issues  
- [ ] Unit tests cover dashboard updates and alert triggers  
- [ ] pytest passes
