## Goal
Strengthen user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Technical approach
Implement OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for secure user authentication. Use Ethers.js to manage cryptographic operations and ensure that all API endpoints are protected by appropriate authorization checks.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Users can authenticate using OAuth 2.0  
- [ ] JWT tokens are validated for each API request  
- [ ] pytest passes for authentication and authorization tests
