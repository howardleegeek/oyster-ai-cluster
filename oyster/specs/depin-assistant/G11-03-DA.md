## Goal  
Implement additional monitoring metrics for system performance.  

## Technical approach  
Add new metrics to the monitoring module to track CPU usage, memory consumption, and network latency. Ensure these metrics are logged and can be accessed via the existing monitoring dashboard. Update tests to cover the new metrics.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 1 new file  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for the new metrics  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] New metrics for CPU, memory, and network are implemented  
- [ ] Metrics are logged and accessible via the monitoring dashboard  
- [ ] Tests for the new metrics are in place  
- [ ] pytest passes
