## Goal  
Enhance system security by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

## Technical approach  
Use Node.js and Ethers.js to integrate MFA into the authentication process. Implement mechanisms for generating and verifying one-time passwords (OTPs) and ensure that all authentication attempts are logged for security auditing.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] MFA is implemented and integrated into the authentication process  
- [ ] OTPs are generated and verified correctly  
- [ ] Authentication attempts are logged for auditing  
- [ ] Unit tests cover MFA functionality and edge cases  
- [ ] pytest passes
