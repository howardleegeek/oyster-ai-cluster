## Goal
Develop a monitoring dashboard to visualize system performance and security metrics.

## Technical approach
Utilize a frontend framework like React to create a dashboard that displays real-time data from the backend. Integrate with backend APIs to fetch metrics such as transaction volumes, error rates, and system health.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dashboard displays real-time system metrics  
- [ ] Data is refreshed at least every 5 seconds  
- [ ] pytest passes for dashboard-related tests
