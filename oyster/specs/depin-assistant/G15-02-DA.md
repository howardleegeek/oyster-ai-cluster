## Goal  
Enhance AI inference capabilities by integrating a pre-trained model for transaction risk assessment.  

## Technical approach  
Use Python's TensorFlow or PyTorch to load and run the pre-trained model. Develop a wrapper in Python that interacts with the Node.js backend via REST API. Ensure the model can assess transaction risks and return results to the core application.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI model is integrated and can assess transaction risks  
- [ ] REST API endpoints are created for AI inference  
- [ ] Unit tests cover API responses for different transaction scenarios  
- [ ] pytest passes
