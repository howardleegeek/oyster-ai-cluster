## Goal  
Integrate AI-driven analytics to provide real-time insights into transaction patterns and user behavior.  

## Technical approach  
Leverage Python's AI libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn) to analyze transaction data. Use Ethers.js to fetch transaction data and pass it to the AI module. Develop a Node.js wrapper to interact with the AI module and expose the insights via API endpoints. Write integration tests to ensure seamless data flow between components.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI module correctly identifies transaction patterns  
- [ ] Real-time insights are available via API endpoints  
- [ ] Data flow between AI and Node.js components is seamless  
- [ ] pytest passes
