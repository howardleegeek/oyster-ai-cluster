## Goal
Enhance transaction validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Technical approach
Utilize Ethers.js to implement additional validation checks for transaction parameters such as nonce, gas limits, and contract addresses. Integrate with existing services to ensure transactions are validated before being broadcasted to the blockchain.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Transactions with invalid parameters are rejected  
- [ ] Validation errors are logged with appropriate severity  
- [ ] pytest passes for transaction validation tests
