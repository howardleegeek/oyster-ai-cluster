## Goal  
Automate the deployment process using a new workflow script.  

## Technical approach  
Create a new workflow script in Node.js to handle the deployment process. Integrate it with the existing automation module and ensure it triggers the correct deployment steps. Add tests to validate the workflow's execution.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 1 new file  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests for the deployment workflow  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] New deployment workflow script is created  
- [ ] Integration with the automation module is successful  
- [ ] Tests for the deployment workflow are in place  
- [ ] pytest passes
