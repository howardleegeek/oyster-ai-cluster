## Goal  
Integrate AI-powered chatbot for customer support using a third-party API.  

## Technical approach  
Use the Ethers.js library to handle any blockchain-related interactions required by the AI integration. Implement the chatbot API calls and process responses within the existing AI module. Write tests to ensure the chatbot responds correctly to queries queries and handles errors gracefully.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] AI chatbot responds correctly to customer queries  
- [ ] Blockchain interactions are handled securely and correctly  
- [ ] pytest passes
