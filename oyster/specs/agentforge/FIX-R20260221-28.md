## Goal  
Implement a modular service layer in `main.py` to support future microservices architecture.  

## Technical approach  
1. Refactor the existing `main.py` to encapsulate core functionalities into a dedicated service module.  
2. Use standard Python tools and adhere to PEP 8 standards.  
3. Implement a simple service class with methods representing core functionalities.  
4. Write unit tests in `test_main.py` to ensure the service layer works as expected.  

## Constraints  
- Do not create more than 2 new files (`main.py` and `test_main.py` are the only files to be modified).  
- Ensure no existing functionality is broken.  
- Do not introduce any `TODO` or `FIXME` comments.  
- Use only standard Python libraries.  
- Include pytest-based tests for the new service layer.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] The service layer is implemented in `main.py` with at least 3 core methods.  
- [ ] The existing functionalities in `main.py` are preserved and work as before.  
- [ ] All tests in `test_main.py` pass with 100% coverage of the service layer.  
- [ ] No linting errors are present (checked by flake8 or similar).  
- [ ] The implementation follows PEP 8 standards.
