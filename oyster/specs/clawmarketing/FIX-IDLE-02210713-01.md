## Goal
Implement a Python script to analyze competitor code architecture and extract key product features.

## Technical approach
1. Create a Python script that uses standard libraries (e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`) to fetch and parse competitor websites.
2. Extract relevant information such as product features, architecture patterns, and technology stack.
3. Store the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for further analysis.
4. Write unit tests for the script to ensure accurate data extraction and handling.

## Constraints
- Do not modify existing code unrelated to the analysis tools.
- Use only standard Python libraries or widely-used third-party libraries.
- Ensure the script runs without requiring additional system dependencies.
- Maintain the existing code structure and coding standards.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] The script `competitor_analysis.py` successfully fetches and parses competitor websites.
- [x] Extracted data is stored in a structured JSON format.
- [x] The script passes all unit tests in `test_competitor_analysis.py`.
- [x] No existing code is broken or altered unintentionally.
- [x] The task completes within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 5 minutes).
