## Goal
Generate a Python script that analyzes the architecture and key features of competitor code for clawmarketing.

## Technical approach
1. Create a Python script `src/competitor_analysis.py` that uses standard libraries to parse and analyze competitor code repositories.
2. Implement functions to extract and summarize key architectural components and features.
3. Develop unit tests in `tests/test_competitor_analysis.py` to ensure the script correctly identifies and summarizes components.
4. Ensure the script outputs the analysis to a structured format (e.g., JSON or Markdown) that can be easily integrated into `docs/research.md`.

## Constraints
- Do not modify any existing code in the clawmarketing repository.
- Use only standard Python libraries (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `json`, `re`).
- Ensure the script runs without requiring any external dependencies or obscure CLIs.
- The analysis should be reproducible and not depend on external network calls during execution.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] The script `src/competitor_analysis.py` successfully parses and analyzes competitor code repositories.
- [x] The analysis output is saved to a structured format (e.g., JSON or Markdown) and can be integrated into `docs/research.md`.
- [x] The unit tests in `tests/test_competitor_analysis.py` cover at least 80% of the script's functionality.
- [x] The script does not modify any files outside of the specified `modifies` paths.
- [x] The script runs without errors on a standard Python environment.
