## Goal
Optimize the performance monitoring module to handle higher data throughput and reduce latency.

## Technical approach
Refactor the `monitor_performance` function in `performance.py` to use asynchronous processing and improve the efficiency of data aggregation. Update the `test_performance.py` unit tests to ensure the refactored function maintains accuracy and improves performance.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the optimized performance monitoring

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The `monitor_performance` function handles at least 50% higher data throughput
- [ ] The function's latency is reduced by at least 20%
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass
- [ ] New unit tests cover the optimized functionality
- [ ] pytest passes
