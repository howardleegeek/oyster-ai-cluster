## Goal
Improve the efficiency of the data processing pipeline by optimizing the data cleaning function.

## Technical approach
Refactor the `clean_data` function in `data_processing.py` to use vectorized operations with NumPy and Pandas, reducing the number of iterations and improving performance. Update the corresponding unit tests in `test_data_processing.py` to validate the optimized function.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the refactored function

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The `clean_data` function runs at least 30% faster on sample data
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass
- [ ] New unit tests cover the optimized functionality
- [ ] pytest passes
