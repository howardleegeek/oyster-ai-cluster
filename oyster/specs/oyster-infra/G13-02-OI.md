## Goal
Integrate a new AI model for predictive analytics in the AI module.

## Technical approach
Incorporate the new AI model using a Python API wrapper. Update the AI integration module to load and utilize the model for predictions. Ensure the model is compatible with existing data pipelines.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the AI model integration

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The new AI model provides predictions with at least 90% accuracy
- [ ] Integration does not introduce latency in the data pipeline
- [ ] pytest passes for the AI integration module
