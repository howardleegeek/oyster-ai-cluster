## Goal  
Enhance the security monitoring system to detect and alert on suspicious activities.  

## Technical approach  
Implement anomaly detection algorithms in `monitor.py` to identify potential security threats. Update the security tests in `test_security_monitor.py` to validate the new monitoring capabilities.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Security monitor detects and alerts on simulated threats  
- [ ] pytest passes
