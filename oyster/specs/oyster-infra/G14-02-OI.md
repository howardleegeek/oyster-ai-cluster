## Goal
Integrate AI-driven decision-making into the automation pipeline.

## Technical approach
1. Create an `AIDecisionMaker` class in `integration.py` that interfaces with an AI service.
2. Implement methods to receive AI-driven decisions and apply them to the automation workflow.
3. Write tests in `test_ai_integration.py` to ensure AI decisions are correctly interpreted and applied.
4. Ensure the integration is modular and can be easily replaced or updated.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files.
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder.
- Write basic tests.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `AIDecisionMaker` can receive and interpret AI-driven decisions.
- [ ] AI decisions are applied to the automation workflow without errors.
- [ ] pytest passes.
