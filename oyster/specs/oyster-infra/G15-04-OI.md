## Goal
Implement a new security feature to sanitize user inputs and prevent SQL injection.

## Technical approach
Add a `sanitize_input` function in `security.py` that uses regular expressions to sanitize user inputs. Update the `test_security.py` unit tests to verify the effectiveness of the sanitization process.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the new security feature

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The `sanitize_input` function correctly sanitizes sample inputs
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass
- [ ] New unit tests cover the sanitization functionality
- [ ] pytest passes
