## Goal
Enhance AI integration by implementing a new feature to preprocess data for machine learning models.

## Technical approach
Add a new method `preprocess_for_ml` in `ai_integration.py` that handles data normalization, feature scaling, and encoding of categorical variables. Develop unit tests in `test_ai_integration.py` to ensure the correctness of the preprocessing steps.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the new preprocessing feature

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The `preprocess_for_ml` method correctly normalizes, scales, and encodes sample data
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass
- [ ] New unit tests cover the preprocessing functionality
- [ ] pytest passes
