## Goal
Develop a monitoring dashboard for real-time system performance tracking.

## Technical approach
Create a dashboard using a Python visualization library to display key performance metrics. Integrate the dashboard with the existing monitoring module to fetch and display data in real-time.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the monitoring dashboard functionality

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The dashboard displays real-time system performance metrics
- [ ] The dashboard is accessible via a web interface
- [ ] pytest passes for the monitoring module
