## Goal  
Implement real-time object recognition using Python's OpenCV and a pre-trained TensorFlow model within the existing codebase.  

## Technical approach  
1. Utilize OpenCV for real-time image processing and TensorFlow for object recognition.  
2. Integrate the object recognition logic into the `new-ventures/object_recognition.py` file.  
3. Write unit tests for the recognition functionality in `tests/test_object_recognition.py` using pytest.  
4. Ensure no more than three new files are created, adhering to the constraint of modifying existing files.  

## Constraints  
- Modify only the specified files: `new-ventures/object_recognition.py` and `tests/test_object_recognition.py`.  
- Do not create more than three new files.  
- Avoid using obscure CLIs or non-standard tools; use standard Python libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow, pytest).  
- Do not leave any TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in the code.  
- Ensure existing functionalities remain unaffected.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] Real-time object recognition is implemented and functional.  
- [x] The implementation does not break any existing features in the `new-ventures` module.  
- [x] Unit tests in `tests/test_object_recognition.py` cover core recognition scenarios and pass successfully.  
- [x] All tests, including existing ones, run with pytest and pass (pytest exit code 0).
