## Goal
Implement a performance optimizer to enhance core functionality efficiency.

## Technical approach
1. Develop a `PerformanceOptimizer` class in `performance_optimizer.py` that analyzes and optimizes system performance.
2. Implement optimization strategies such as resource allocation and task scheduling.
3. Write tests in `test_performance_optimizer.py` to verify the optimizer's effectiveness.
4. Ensure the optimizer does not interfere with existing core functionality.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files.
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder.
- Write basic tests.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The optimizer identifies and resolves performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] System performance metrics improve after optimization.
- [ ] pytest passes.
