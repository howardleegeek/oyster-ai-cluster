## Goal
Develop a monitoring dashboard to visualize system and application metrics.

## Technical approach
1. Create a `Dashboard` class in `dashboard.py` that retrieves and displays metrics.
2. Implement visualization components using a suitable Python visualization library.
3. Write tests in `test_dashboard.py` to ensure the dashboard displays metrics correctly.
4. Ensure the dashboard is responsive and user-friendly.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files.
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder.
- Write basic tests.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The dashboard displays CPU, memory, and disk I/O metrics.
- [ ] Visualization components render correctly and update in real-time.
- [ ] pytest passes.
