## Goal
Automate the deployment process using shell scripts and Python.

## Technical approach
Develop shell scripts to handle the deployment steps and integrate them with the existing Python automation module. Ensure the scripts are idempotent and handle errors gracefully.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the deployment automation

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Deployment process is fully automated
- [ ] Shell scripts handle errors and are idempotent
- [ ] pytest passes for the automation module
