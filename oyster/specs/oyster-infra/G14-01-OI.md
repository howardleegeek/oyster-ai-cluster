## Goal
Implement a performance monitoring module to track core functionality metrics in real-time.

## Technical approach
1. Develop a `PerformanceMonitor` class in `performance_monitor.py` that collects system and application metrics.
2. Integrate the class into the existing core functionality modules.
3. Write unit tests in `test_performance_monitor.py` to verify metric collection and reporting.
4. Ensure the module is lightweight and does not impact core performance.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files.
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder.
- Write basic tests.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `PerformanceMonitor` collects CPU, memory, and disk I/O metrics.
- [ ] Metrics are logged to a file and accessible via an API.
- [ ] pytest passes.
