## Goal
Update the deployment script and documentation to include steps for setting up the new monitoring dashboard.

## Technical approach
Modify the `deploy.sh` script to include commands for installing and configuring the monitoring dashboard. Update the `deployment.md` documentation to reflect the changes, providing clear instructions for setting up the dashboard.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the deployment script

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The `deploy.sh` script successfully installs and configures the monitoring dashboard
- [ ] The `deployment.md` documentation includes accurate and clear instructions for setting up the dashboard
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass
- [ ] pytest passes
