## Goal
Implement enhanced security measures for data handling and storage.

## Technical approach
Update the security module to include encryption for data at rest and in transit. Implement access controls and audit logging for sensitive operations. Update documentation to reflect the new security measures.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the security enhancements

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit
- [ ] Access controls are enforced for sensitive operations
- [ ] Audit logs are generated for all security-related events
- [ ] pytest passes for the security module
