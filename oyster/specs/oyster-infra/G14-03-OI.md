## Goal
Enhance the authentication system with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Technical approach
1. Update the `Authentication` class in `authentication.py` to support MFA.
2. Implement MFA token generation and verification methods.
3. Write tests in `test_authentication.py` to ensure MFA functionality works as expected.
4. Ensure the authentication system remains secure and efficient.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files.
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder.
- Write basic tests.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] MFA tokens are generated and sent to the user.
- [ ] MFA tokens are verified and authenticated successfully.
- [ ] pytest passes.
