## Goal
Enhance the data processing module to handle large datasets more efficiently.

## Technical approach
Refactor the data processing module to utilize multiprocessing for parallel data handling. Implement chunking of data to manage memory usage effectively. Update existing functions to leverage the new processing paradigm.

## Constraints
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder
- Write basic tests for the refactored functions

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Data processing speed increases by at least 30% for large datasets
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during processing
- [ ] pytest passes for the updated data processing module
