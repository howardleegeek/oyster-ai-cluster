## Goal  
Improve the data processing efficiency by optimizing the data cleaning pipeline.  

## Technical approach  
Refactor the data cleaning functions in `data_processor.py` to use more efficient data structures and algorithms. Update the unit tests in `test_data_processor.py` to cover the new implementation.  

## Constraints  
- Modify within existing codebase, no more than 3 new files  
- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder  
- Write basic tests  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Data cleaning functions execute 20% faster on average  
- [ ] pytest passes
