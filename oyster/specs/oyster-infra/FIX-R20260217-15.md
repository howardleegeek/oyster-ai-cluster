## Goal  
Develop a routing algorithm for efficient LLM selection and processing within the existing codebase.

## Technical approach  
1. Implement the routing algorithm in Python using standard libraries such as `functools` and `itertools`.  
2. Ensure the algorithm selects the appropriate LLM based on predefined criteria (e.g., task type, load balancing).  
3. Write unit tests using `pytest` to verify the correctness of the routing logic and ensure no regression in existing functionality.  
4. Avoid using any obscure or non-standard CLI tools.

## Constraints  
- Modify only the specified files: `routing_algorithm.py` and `routing_algorithm_test.py`.  
- Do not create more than one additional file for the implementation.  
- Do not leave any `TODO`, `FIXME`, or placeholder comments in the code.  
- Ensure all changes are compatible with the existing code structure and do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.  
- Write comprehensive tests covering at least 80% of the new code.

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] The routing algorithm correctly selects the appropriate LLM based on input criteria.  
- [x] Existing functionality remains unaffected, verified by existing tests.  
- [x] All new code is covered by unit tests in `routing_algorithm_test.py`.  
- [x] `pytest` runs with no failures or errors on the modified codebase.  
- [x] Code changes are limited to the specified files and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.
