# WHY: Marketing Stack

Oyster Labs needs a unified marketing automation stack that integrates open-source tools (n8n, PostHog, Plausible, Listmonk, Twenty CRM, SerpBear) to drive growth across all products. Currently marketing is fragmented across manual processes with no data-driven feedback loop. This stack enables automated multi-channel campaigns, analytics-driven content, and CRM integration at zero SaaS cost.
