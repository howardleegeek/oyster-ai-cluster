## Goal  
Implement a Python script to perform performance benchmark analysis for bluesky-poster and generate a report in docs/research.md.

## Technical approach  
1. Develop a Python script (`performance_analysis.py`) that utilizes standard libraries (e.g., `time`, `cProfile`) to measure the performance of key functions in bluesky-poster.  
2. Implement a function to analyze the collected performance data and identify potential optimization opportunities.  
3. Update `docs/research.md` with the analysis results.  
4. Create unit tests in `test_performance_analysis.py` to ensure the script's correctness and reliability.  

## Constraints  
- Do not modify existing code outside of the specified files.  
- Use only standard Python tools and libraries.  
- Ensure the script is compatible with the existing codebase.  
- The analysis report must be clear and actionable.  
- Include comprehensive test coverage for the benchmarking script.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] A new Python script `performance_analysis.py` is added to the `src/benchmarking/` directory.  
- [x] The script successfully collects and analyzes performance data from bluesky-poster.  
- [x] The analysis report is appended to `docs/research.md`.  
- [x] A new test file `tests/test_performance_analysis.py` is created with at least 80% test coverage for `performance_analysis.py`.  
- [x] The script does not introduce any new errors or break existing functionality.  
- [x] The report includes specific, actionable recommendations for performance improvements.
