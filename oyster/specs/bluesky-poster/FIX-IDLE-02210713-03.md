## Goal  
Implement a Python script to perform performance benchmarking and identify optimization opportunities for bluesky-poster.  

## Technical approach  
1. Create a Python script that uses the `cProfile` module to profile the application's performance.  
2. Analyze the profiling data to identify bottlenecks and suggest optimization strategies.  
3. Implement unit tests for the benchmarking script using the `unittest` framework.  
4. Update the documentation with the findings and recommendations.  

## Constraints  
- Do not modify the existing application code outside of the benchmarking script.  
- Use only standard Python tools (`cProfile`, `unittest`).  
- Ensure the script runs without requiring additional dependencies.  
- Output the analysis results to `docs/research.md`.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] The benchmarking script successfully profiles the application and identifies at least three optimization opportunities.  
- [x] The script completes execution without errors on the CI/CD pipeline.  
- [x] Unit tests for the benchmarking script are implemented and pass.  
- [x] The `docs/research.md` file is updated with the analysis report and optimization suggestions.  
- [x] No existing application functionality is broken, verified by passing all existing tests.
