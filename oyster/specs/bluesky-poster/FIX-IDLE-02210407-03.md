## Goal  
Implement performance benchmark analysis and optimization suggestions for bluesky-poster.

## Technical approach  
1. Create a Python script `performance_analysis.py` to analyze the codebase for performance bottlenecks using standard profiling tools like `cProfile`.  
2. Implement optimization suggestions based on the analysis.  
3. Write unit tests for the analysis functions in `test_performance_analysis.py` to ensure accurate and reliable results.  
4. Ensure the script outputs the analysis report to `docs/research.md` without modifying existing code.

## Constraints  
- The script must use standard Python tools (e.g., `cProfile`, `timeit`).  
- Do not modify any existing code outside of the specified files.  
- The analysis must be comprehensive and provide actionable optimization suggestions.  
- Ensure the script is executable on standard worker nodes without requiring additional installations.  
- Output the analysis report to `docs/research.md`.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] The script `performance_analysis.py` successfully analyzes the codebase and identifies performance bottlenecks.  
- [x] The script provides concrete optimization suggestions in `docs/research.md`.  
- [x] The script does not modify any existing code outside of `src/benchmarking/performance_analysis.py` and `tests/benchmarking/test_performance_analysis.py`.  
- [x] Unit tests in `tests/benchmarking/test_performance_analysis.py` cover the core functionality of the analysis script and pass successfully.  
- [x] The analysis report is comprehensive and provides actionable insights.
