## Goal  
Implement a performance benchmarking script for bluesky-poster and generate an analysis report.

## Technical approach  
1. Develop a Python script that performs benchmarking on key components of bluesky-poster.  
2. Use standard Python libraries such as `time`, `cProfile`, and `memory_profiler` for profiling.  
3. Generate a structured report in `docs/research.md` summarizing performance metrics and optimization opportunities.  
4. Include unit tests for the benchmarking script to ensure reliability.

## Constraints  
- Do not modify existing core functionality of bluesky-poster.  
- Use only standard Python tools for benchmarking and analysis.  
- Ensure the script is compatible with the current codebase.  
- The report should be clear, concise, and actionable.  
- Include comprehensive test coverage for the benchmarking script.

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] A new Python script `performance_analysis.py` is added to the `src/benchmarking` directory.  
- [x] The script performs benchmarking on at least three key components of bluesky-poster.  
- [x] The benchmarking results are written to `docs/research.md` in a structured format.  
- [x] Unit tests for the benchmarking script are added to `tests/test_performance_analysis.py`.  
- [x] All tests pass without errors.  
- [x] The existing codebase remains unchanged and functional.
