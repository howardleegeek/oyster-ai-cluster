## Goal  
Implement a performance benchmark script for bluesky-poster and add corresponding unit tests.  

## Technical approach  
1. Create a `benchmark.py` script in the `src/performance` directory to measure the execution time of key functions in bluesky-poster.  
2. Implement the benchmarking using standard Python libraries such as `time` and `cProfile`.  
3. Add unit tests for the benchmarking script in `test_benchmark.py` within the `tests/performance` directory using Python's `unittest` framework.  
4. Ensure the benchmark script does not modify any existing code but provides insights into performance bottlenecks.  

## Constraints  
- Do not modify any existing application code outside of the `src/performance` and `tests/performance` directories.  
- Use only standard Python tools and libraries.  
- The benchmark script should be executable via the command line.  
- The tests must cover at least 80% of the benchmark script's functionality.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] A `benchmark.py` script exists in `src/performance` that measures the execution time of key functions.  
- [x] The benchmark script uses standard Python libraries and does not rely on external or obscure tools.  
- [x] A `test_benchmark.py` file exists in `tests/performance` with unit tests covering the benchmark script.  
- [x] The unit tests achieve at least 80% code coverage for the benchmark script.  
- [x] The benchmark script can be executed via the command line and outputs meaningful performance data.  
- [x] The implementation does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing codebase.
