## Goal  
Implement a performance benchmarking and analysis module for bluesky-poster.  

## Technical approach  
1. Develop a Python script that uses the `time` and `cProfile` modules to measure the execution time and profile the performance of key functions in the bluesky-poster application.  
2. Implement a function to analyze the profiling data and identify potential optimization opportunities.  
3. Create a test file to verify the correctness of the benchmarking and analysis module.  
4. Update the documentation to reflect the changes and include usage instructions for the new module.  

## Constraints  
- Do not modify existing core functionality of the bluesky-poster application.  
- Use only standard Python tools (`time`, `cProfile`, `unittest`).  
- Ensure the benchmarking module is modular and can be easily integrated or removed.  
- The analysis output should be saved to `docs/research.md` in a structured format.  
- All changes must pass existing linting and testing checks.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] A new Python script `performance_analysis.py` is added to the `src/benchmarking` directory.  
- [x] The script includes functionality to measure execution time and profile key functions.  
- [x] A test file `test_performance_analysis.py` is created in the `tests` directory, containing unit tests for the benchmarking module.  
- [x] The tests cover at least three different scenarios, including successful profiling and analysis of sample functions.  
- [x] The `docs/research.md` file is updated with a section on performance benchmarking, including instructions on how to run the analysis and interpret the results.  
- [x] The changes pass all existing linting and testing checks without introducing new errors.  
- [x] The benchmarking module does not interfere with the existing functionality of the bluesky-poster application.
