## Goal  
Implement a reliable performance benchmark script for bluesky-poster and create comprehensive unit tests.  

## Technical approach  
1. Develop `benchmark.py` in the `src/performance` directory to measure the execution time of critical functions using Python's `time` and `cProfile` modules.  
2. Ensure the benchmark script is executable via the command line and outputs clear, actionable performance data.  
3. Create `test_benchmark.py` in the `tests/performance` directory with unit tests using Python's `unittest` framework.  
4. Verify that the unit tests achieve at least 80% code coverage for `benchmark.py`.  
5. Ensure no existing application code is modified outside of the specified directories.  

## Constraints  
- Do not alter any code outside of `src/performance` and `tests/performance`.  
- Utilize only standard Python libraries and tools.  
- The benchmark script must be executable from the command line.  
- The unit tests must cover at least 80% of the benchmark script's functionality.  
- The implementation must not introduce breaking changes to the existing codebase.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] `benchmark.py` exists in `src/performance` and measures the execution time of key functions.  
- [x] The benchmark script uses only standard Python libraries (`time`, `cProfile`).  
- [x] `test_benchmark.py` exists in `tests/performance` with unit tests for the benchmark script.  
- [x] The unit tests achieve at least 80% code coverage for `benchmark.py`.  
- [x] The benchmark script can be executed from the command line and outputs meaningful performance data.  
- [x] The implementation preserves the integrity of the existing codebase without introducing breaking changes.
