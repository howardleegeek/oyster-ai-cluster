## Goal
Review and improve code quality in the most recently modified files


## Identified Risks
- No advisors available — using codebase heuristics only


## Constraints
- Work within the existing codebase structure
- Write meaningful tests for new functionality
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Do not change UI/CSS unless explicitly required

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] Changes are minimal and focused

## Do NOT
- Restructure the project layout
- Add unnecessary dependencies
- Over-engineer the solution
