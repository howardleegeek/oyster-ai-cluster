## Goal  
Develop a function to generate AI-driven social media content within the existing contentforge module.  

## Technical approach  
1. Implement a `generate_social_media_content` function in `generator.py` that takes input parameters such as platform, topic, and length.  
2. Use standard Python libraries (e.g., `random`, `string`) for content generation.  
3. Ensure the function is modular and can be easily extended for additional platforms or content types.  
4. Write unit tests in `tests/test_generator.py` to verify the functionality of the content generation, including edge cases and typical scenarios.  
5. Ensure no existing functionality is broken by running existing tests and adding new ones as needed.  

## Constraints  
- Modify only the specified files (`generator.py` and `tests/test_generator.py`).  
- Do not create more than one new file (`tests/test_generator.py` is allowed).  
- Avoid using obscure or non-standard CLI tools.  
- Ensure all code changes are covered by the newly added tests.  
- Do not leave any TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in the code.  
- Do not refactor existing code unrelated to the new feature unless necessary for integration.  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] A new function `generate_social_media_content` is implemented in `generator.py`.  
- [x] The function accepts parameters for platform, topic, and length, and returns AI-generated content.  
- [x] The function uses only standard Python libraries.  
- [x] Unit tests are added in `tests/test_generator.py` covering:  
  - Successful generation of content for each supported platform.  
  - Content generation with varying lengths.  
  - Handling of edge cases (e.g., empty input, unsupported platforms).  
- [x] All existing tests pass after the changes.  
- [x] No existing functionality is broken, verified by a clean run of the test suite (`pytest`).
