## Goal  
Integrate AI-driven content optimization by enhancing the `ai_content_optimizer` module with a new feature to analyze and suggest improvements for social media content.  

## Technical approach  
1. Implement a new function `suggest_improvements` in `ai_content_optimizer.py` that takes social media content as input and returns suggested improvements.  
2. Utilize a pre-trained AI model from a reliable library (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) to analyze and generate suggestions.  
3. Ensure the function is compatible with existing code by adhering to the current module structure and input/output formats.  
4. Write unit tests in `tests/test_ai_content_optimizer.py` to verify the correctness of the new feature, including edge cases and typical use cases.  
5. Ensure no existing functionality is broken by running existing tests and verifying their success.  

## Constraints  
- Modify only the specified files.  
- Do not create more than one new file.  
- Use standard Python libraries and tools (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers).  
- Do not leave any TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments.  
- Ensure all tests pass (pytest).  

## Acceptance criteria  
- [x] The `suggest_improvements` function is implemented and correctly suggests improvements for social media content.  
- [x] No existing functionality in `ai_content_optimizer.py` is broken.  
- [x] All existing and new unit tests pass (pytest shows all tests as green).  
- [x] The implementation adheres to the current module structure and input/output formats.  
- [x] The new feature is covered by unit tests in `tests/test_ai_content_optimizer.py`.
